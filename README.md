# sunfounder-lessons-remastered
Arduino code from Sunfounder lessons converted into more legible code

In this project I intend to convert every lesson from "Super Kit V3.0 for Arduino" from the Sunfounder Lessons page into more legible code
for the use of beginners to more easily learn how to program and use an Arduino UNO
